\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Course Description}

\textbf{MAT 733 Commutative Algebra}: Localization, primary decomposition, and dimension theory; Nullstellensatz; Artin-Rees lemma and completion; integral and flat extensions; Koszul complex, Cohen-Macaulay and regular rings.

\subsection{Disclaimer}

These notes were taken in Spring 2016 in a course taught by Professor Graham Leuschke. In some places, notation/material has been changed or added. Any errors in this text should be attributed to the typist -- Caleb McWhorter -- and not the instructor or any referenced text. 

\subsection{Assumptions}

Unless otherwise stated, all rings will be taken to be commutative with identity. All modules will be considered to be left $R$-modules. For ring and module homomorphisms, $\varphi: R \rightarrow S$, it is assumed that $\varphi(1_R)=1_S$.
